## ⚠️ Disclaimer

> **This project is for educational and demonstration purposes only.**
> It is designed to show how GitHub Actions can be used for scheduled automation tasks — not for inflating contributions or misleading viewers.

Automating your GitHub activity can be a **fun and informative** way to learn about CI/CD, bots, scripting, and workflows — but it's important to use this responsibly:

- Be **transparent** in your usage
- Avoid **spammy or misleading behavior**
- Present it clearly as a **testbed for learning automation**

🧪 Built for learning, not for production.  
💚 Happy green squares!
